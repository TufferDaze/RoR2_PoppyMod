## Known Issues
* Standing still during Steadfast Pressence looks jank.
* Iron Ambassador counts as a boss item, allowing you to print boss tier items with the Command artifact.
* Charging into larger enemies with Heroic Charge may put you under the map.

## TODO
* Tweak for better network play.
* Make new animations for walking sideways/backwards.
* Clean up existing animations.
* Add VFX for all skills.
* Add skins.
* Add other skills.
* Add something secret. ;)
